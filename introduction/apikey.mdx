## Make sure you save your API Password!

Your API password is a secure key that we use to Authenticate you. When you request your credentials you will only be shown the password **ONCE** so make sure you keep all the details in a secure place. You can reset your API password but your old password will be deleted and no longer usable. You will then need to make sure you update the password in all locations that you are using it in.
