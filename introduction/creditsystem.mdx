## How it works

Our purchasing through the API is based around our credit system. This is what we use to make sure that orders are paid for in a timely manner and can be shipped out quickly. It is a prepaid system where you will need to add credit to the platform before making a purchase.

## Find out how much credit you have

There are 2 ways to find out how much credit you have.<br/>
The first way is via the API using the [GET/api/credit-balance](/api-reference/endpoint/credit/getbalance) API call.<br/>
The secound way is to login to the platform and view your credit page which will have your current total and a list of the transactions. You can see the instructions to view this page on our support potal - [How to view your credit balance](https://support.elliephant.com/portal/en/kb/articles/how-to-view-your-credit-balance)
